You are asked to come up with a set of 10 code review instructions. These code review instructions will be given to a GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions.

Here are the requirements:
1. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output. For another example, do not ask the assistant to wake you up at 5pm or set a reminder because it cannot perform any action.
2. The instructions should be in English.
3. The instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.
4. You should generate an appropriate input to the instruction. The input field should contain a specific example provided for the instruction. It should involve realistic data and should not contain simple placeholders. The input should provide substantial content to make the instruction challenging.
5. The output should be an appropriate response to the instruction and the input.
